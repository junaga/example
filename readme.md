A simple loop that shows why the [Martingale strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)) does not work. After enough coinflips, there **will be** a losing streak, large enough to wipe out all player balance inlcuding previous profits.

## `./port-scanner.py`

Find random servers on the internet. Generates a random IPv4 address and connects to TCP ports 1-1023.
