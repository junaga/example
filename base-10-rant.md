## Decimal sucks

Decimal, is a base-10 positional numeral writing system. It originated from humankind counting in batches of 10, using 10 fingers to reference count.

Both, intentional mathematical design, and biological evolution, could have easily created a more optimized numeral system for humankind. Neither was involved in the creation of decimal, which is based on cavemen psychology from reference counting with fingers. Furthermore, established governance usually justified base-10, with religious claims, about gods intental creation, of the perfectly designed, human body.

Today, we depend on decimal, it's irreplaceable. Countless modern-day decimal system subset notations exist, all trying to fix the issues of base-10.

1. Repeating decimals; half is `0.5`; A third `0.333...`.
2. Scientific notation; `1.8446744e+19` for 64 bits.
3. Percentages; half is `50%`; _statistically non-significant amount sometimes `1%`_.
4. Metric system notations; `1km`, `1kg` for thousands.
5. Social media view counts; `1K` views , `1M` views
6. etc. etc.

Fractions, the second most simple number concept in mathematics, become complex work in decimal, compared to base-6 or base-12.

If humans had to share food 10k years ago using [repeating decimal notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal#Notation), we would have all fucking died.

## base-12, base-60

base-10 is such a weak system, that almost all numeral systems of past civilizations are more advanced.

- [Babylonian numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals)
- [Aegean numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_numerals)
- [Egyptian numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_numerals)
- [Maya numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_numerals)
- [Roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals)
- [Tally marks themselfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_marks)

To this day base-60 is used to measure time.

## the perfect system

A radix `6`, non-positional-notation, numeral system, with unit fraction notations, would have been the most optimal system. With `6` being both:

1. The **mathematically optimal** base (see `./123.py`). In short: `6` has two prime factors `2 * 3`. `60` has 43 nested factors (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30), `100` only 25 (2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50), notice the lack `3`. `3` which is literally the third number in all numbers, can not be fractured into decimal numerals. `3` does basically not exist in decimal.

2. The **biologically optimal** base. `5` is the highest amount, of objects or subjects that can be perceived, by any hunting mammal subspecies-derived individual, without consciously active counting. `6` is the first count number, not `1`. Humans don't need to count things less than `6`. This is seen in Aegan numerals (see below) which count, read, and write in `2` `3` `2*2` `3*2-1` `3*2`, `4*2-1`, `4*2`, `3*3`

## imho

`6` is the first number, and `60` should be our `100`. With sixty being `12 * 5`. Finally `7` should be `6 + 1`.

The reason we use base-10 is because we have 10 fingers to count with. From the possible 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 16 total fingers, odds are not likely with biological bilateral symmetry, only two possibilities, 2 and 14 fingers, would have been mathematically less optional than 10. That's 3 out of 8 cases and less than 50%. The fact that humans have 10 and not 4, 6, 8, 12, or 16 fingers, indicates that our species is a _genetic misshap_, not a _designed creature_.
